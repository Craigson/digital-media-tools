## Review
It can take up to 4000 samples of laser ranging per second with high rotation speed. And equipped with SLAMTEC patented OPTMAG technology, it breakouts the life limitation of traditional LIDAR system so as to work stably for a long time.

The system can perform 2D 360-degree scan within a 6-meter range. The generated 2D point cloud data can be used in mapping, localization and object/environment modeling.
