# Silicon Labs SI1143/7

## Overview
The SI1143 is the kind of sensor that sits in your smartphone and turns off the screen when you hold it up to your ear, but it's very useful for many other applications. It's range is low, but with some strong IRLEDs you can get signal at 50cm. Since it measures the ambient before it flashes IR it's not very sensitive to sunlight.
It comes with up to three LED-drivers, meaning you can do rudimentary gesture recognition to.
