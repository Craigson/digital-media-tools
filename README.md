#human instrumentation project

This repository is an attempt to keep a log of useful sensor technologies for use in interactive creative pieces.

## how to contribute

This repository only exists because of the people that contribute to it!  The more people contribute, the more useful this repo will be for everyone.

The best way to help is to add sensors!  Here's how:

* Clone the git repository.
* Make a copy of the template (`template.md`) and fill it in to the best of your ability!  Be sure to place it in the appropriate folder based on sensor type.
* Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) with your changes!

At the moment, summaries of each sensor technology would also be super helpful; if you're feeling ambitious and want to provide an overview, go for it!
