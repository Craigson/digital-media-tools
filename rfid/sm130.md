## Review

The SonMicro SM130 is by far one of the cheapest and simplest readers/antennas you can get (costing about $30 - $40 for a setup), but at a cost -- the detection area is no larger than an index card, the range is limited to 3-6 inches, and it can only read one tag at a time. That said, it's simplicity and cost-effectiveness make it a solid option for many use cases.
