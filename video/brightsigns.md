## Review
They're kind of finicky to set up.

Things to know:

Always, always, always make sure the firmware is updated; instructions are [here](https://brightsign.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/218066817-How-do-I-update-the-Firmware-on-a-BrightSign-player-).  Firmware older than 6.2.96 is unable to read SD cards that are formatted with exFAT (standard in Windows).

You'll also want to make sure that video is encoded properly according to BrightSign's [supported video formats and codecs](https://brightsign.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/218065137-Supported-video-formats-and-codecs).

There's lots of little details that can go wrong, but once they're set up, they work great!
