## Review
The ZED Camera works extremely well; it has a very deep field of vision ranging from 3' to over 60'.  It
also doesn't use structured light (just plain stereo RGB images), so you can easily use multiple cameras
in a space without them interfering with each other.

Stereo Lab's library requires an NVIDIA graphics card and CUDA in order to run, and the ZED needs a USB
3.0 port in order to have enough bandwidth for images.
