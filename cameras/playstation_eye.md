## Review / Description
The PS3 Eye Camera is an extremely cheap camera that works pretty great for quick and dirty installation purposes!  It's also VERY fast -- 120 Hz at 320x240 resolution or 60 Hz at 640x480 resolution, which ability to go up to 150% faster with proper firmware drivers.  The consumer version of the camera comes with a two-setting fixed focus zoom lens that can be set to 55 degrees or 75 degrees, while the Peau Productions version comes with either a CS or M12 mount that allows you to grab a lens from just about anywhere and attach it.

The only annoying part of using the camera is limited resolution (which is not often an issue) and that it uses USB, so it needs to be very close to the computer or you need to get USB Extenders.
