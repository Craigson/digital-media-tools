## Review

The FLIR A325sc is a scientific quality thermal camera thatâ€™s interesting because it actually has lensing options (germanium lenses!), and is reasonably priced.  It connects to your computer via Gigabit Ethernet and acts like any old camera, but you get thermal data instead.  This makes it extremely resilient to fluctuations in ambient light and clothing reflectivity.

It has a limited number of lensing options, but for what it is it's probably the most flexible LWIR camera on the market.
