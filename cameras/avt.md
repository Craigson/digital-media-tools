## Review
These cameras are built like *tanks*, and work over Gigabit Ethernet so you don't have to worry about USB Cables, and have decent framerates at usable resolutions.  They also have a variety of onboard image processing and camera control features (like gain control, external triggers, multicasting, binning, etc.) and use standard lenses.

Good models for computer vision (good IR response -- 20%+ quantum efficiency) include:

* [Manta G-095](http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/cameras/gigabit-ethernet/manta/g-095c.html) ($750)
* [Manta G-125](http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/cameras/gigabit-ethernet/manta/g-125bc.html) ($895)
* [Prosilica GC750](http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/cameras/gigabit-ethernet/prosilica-gc/gc750.html) ($795)
* [Mako G-125B](http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/cameras/gigabit-ethernet/mako/g-125.html) ($595)

All of the above are 1/3" cameras, and thus have interchangeable lenses.  They each also come in a full RGB camera, though prices are listed for the monochrome cameras.

Other cameras worth mentioning, but the next price tier up (but also > 1 MP):

* [Manta G-419 NIR](http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/cameras/gigabit-ethernet/manta/g-419b-nir.html) ($2300)
* [Mako G-223 NIR](http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/cameras/gigabit-ethernet/mako/g-223b-nir.html) ($1475)
