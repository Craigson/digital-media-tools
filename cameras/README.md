# Cameras

Cameras can be used to do much more than proximity detection using CV techniques, and are useful when you need to do something more complex such at object tracking, contour detection, or just tracking of many objects in a large space.

## Advantages

* Extremely flexible
* Can go gestural recognition

## Disadvnatages

* Much more computationally intensive (almost always need some sort of computer vision algoritms)

## Best Practices
