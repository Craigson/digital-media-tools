# Capacitive Sensors

Capacitive sensors use a human body as a ground to discharge a capacitor plate being charged by the sensor.  They are great for use cases where line of sight cannot be guaranteed (through a barrier), but where accuracy is not required.

## Advantages

* Easy to conceal
* Robust when well-tuned
* Doesn't need line-of-sight with target

## Disadvantages

* Tuning can be a pain
* It can be very difficult to measure distance
* susceptable to interference from metal objects

## Best Practices
