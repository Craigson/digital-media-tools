# Sonar Sensors

## Advantages
Longer distances (5 - 30 ft), good repeatability, not sensitive to sunlight

## Disadvnatages
can interfere with each other; using many requires a bit of setup and infrastructure; echoes can be a problem

## Best Practices

All sonars within line of sight of each other must be triggered simultaneously or one at a time.
